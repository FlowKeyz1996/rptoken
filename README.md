# ICO PreSale (ERC20 Token) DApp

Build & Deploy ICO PreSale (ERC20 Token) DApp for RpToken | Solidity + Next.js | Binance, Polygon, Ethereum

In this project, we will build and deploy a full-stack ICO PreSale DApp from scratch using Solidity, Next.js, and Web3 tools. We'll create an ERC20 token, build a presale smart contract, and deploy it on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, and Ethereum. The frontend will be developed in Next.js and integrated using wagmi, web3.js, and Web3 Provider to connect user wallets like MetaMask.


- web3.js & wagmi for Web3 functionality
- Web3 Provider for wallet connections
